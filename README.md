# 8-bit-SRAM-physical-layout-design
This project designs an 8-bit SRAM layout using Cadence Virtuoso. It includes creating the layout, performing DRC, validating with LVS, and extracting parasitics for post-layout simulations. The focus is on accurate design and verification of SRAM with integrated read/write circuits, crucial in digital systems.
